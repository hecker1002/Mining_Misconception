## Mining Misconception 

This is a nptebook I sued to do teh submission in the OCntest - "Mining Misconception" where I had to specify the wrong answers and the reason for it corresponding to a simple amthematical quuestion . 
I used here a LLama 2 - 7b and fine tuned it on a custom made dataset .
